# Johann George Albrechtsberger (1736-1809)

Johann Albrechtsberger was an Austrian composer, music theorist, and teacher. He was one of the most learned musicians of his time and had a profound influence on later composers, including the famous pupil Ludwig van Beethoven. 

One of his most notable works is his Concerto for the Alto Trombone and Orchestra in Bâ™­ Major (1759). Few works of trombone can be traced back to classical times. His Alto Trombone Concerto is frequently played in modern times, and is one of the essential repertoires of trombone performers.

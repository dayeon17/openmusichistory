# Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583–1643)

Italian composer, 
I briefly studied Frescobaldi in a first-year university class. He is a lesser-known composer, but when I listened to his music, I found it incredibly captivating. What I found even more intriguing was the fact that the great composer Bach also studied and transcribed Frescobaldi's music. Since Frescobaldi contributed greatly to the development of keyboard music, I am eager to explore his life and works in more detail.

## About Frescobaldi
Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583–1643) was a pioneer of expressive freedom in early Baroque music, known for his use of flexible tempo. Born in Ferrara, Italy, he gained fame during his lifetime and served as the organist at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Rather than strictly following a fixed beat, he encouraged performers to adjust the tempo according to the emotion and flow of the music.
This approach is clearly evident in pieces like “Gagliarda in G minor,” where rhythmic variations and expressive pacing transform a traditional dance form into a deeply emotional work.
Frescobaldi’s ideas had a profound impact on later composers, especially Johann Sebastian Bach, who studied his music closely. Frescobaldi redefined the role of the performer—not as a mechanical reproducer of notes, but as an interpreter of feeling and expression.
